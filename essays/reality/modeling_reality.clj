;; ## Modeling Reality

;; Let's motivate what we're doing here. Our goal is to model reality. This is a
;; deeply fascinating thing, that we can describe a system, and write down rules
;; for how it evolves over time.... and then we can check the numbers for the
;; real system later, and they will match.

;; Realizing that this was possible, that there were "laws" that govern the way
;; things evolve and that you could make predictions, is a major attack on the
;; question of what the hell is going on all around us. It leads to the
;; probably-safe idea that all sorts of abstractions can be modeled.

;; Give an example of the sort of thing I'm talking about, with modeling of
;; reality. We could do a pendulum example here, and maybe show it evolve.

;; Another bizarre thing is that this modeling works at many levels of reality,
;; and breaks down at others. You can model gases etc using probabilistic laws
;; that break down when you isolate individual particles. And, surprise, it
;; seems like the classical laws we'll investigate first are expected values of
;; very different phenomena at the bottom.

;; Another example here?

;; And then of course we have mathematical abstractions that don't seem to
;; correspond to any reality! But they hang together cohesively, and are worth
;; studying. Do these form the bases of other realities? [[Max Tegmark]] seems
;; to think so. But following the implications of structure turns out to be a
;; nice way to find interesting behavior.

;; Why some laws vs others? Talk about the various rules suggested by setting
;; the dials to different settings.
