;; # Road to Reality Essays

;; Welcome to the Road to Reality!

;; The Road to Reality is an essay series by me, [Sam
;; Ritchie](https://samritchie.io). Starting with the basics of Lisp (the
;; [Clojure](https://clojure.org) programming language, specifically), I'll attempt
;; to build up all of the tools required to explore and play with gems of modern
;; physics like variational mechanics and general relativity, taking the time for
;; interesting side-quests the whole way through.

;; The essays live at https://reality.mentat.org.

;; I publish updates on the essays in the ["Road to Reality" Substack
;; newsletter](https://roadtoreality.substack.com). Please subscribe at
;; https://roadtoreality.substack.com!
